# Graphs

## Introduction

Graph is a data structure used to store and manipulate data. Graphs are used in GPS, neural networks, peer-to-peer networks, search engine crawlers, garbage collection in python, and social network sites.  Let's look more closely to graphs. 

### Graph Structure

A **graph** is a collection of nodes that are connected to each other in the form of a network. Graph has two basics components: 

*   **Vertex** - This is the most essential part of the graph. Think of this as the node.
*   **Edge** - An edge is a link between to vertices. 

Here's how a graph is represented:

### Graph Properties

There are several other properties that we look at now. 

*   **Degree of a Vertex** - This is defined as the total number of edges incident on a vertex. Because the edges depend on the incidents on a vertex, there are two types: 
    *   **In-degree** - these are the total number of incoming edges onto a vertex
    *   **Out-degree** - these are the total number of outgoing edges from a vertex
*   **Parallel Edges** -  Edges that do not have direction are considered parallel if they have the same two vertices. Edges that have direction are said to be parallel if they both start and end from same vertices
*   **Self Loop** - When an edge starts and ends on the same vertex, it is considered a self loop
*   **Adjacency** - Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them directly. 

To illustrate these properties, let's look at the figure above.

*   The in-degree for `a` is 1. So, is the case with `b`. `c` has in-degree of 2 and out-degree of 1. 
*   `c` contains a self loop. 

### Types of Graphs

There are two types of graphs: 

*   **Undirected Graphs** - in these graphs, the edges are bi-directional. We can see in the example below. 

    <img src="Graph_notes.assets/image-20201222133043386.png" alt="image-20201222133043386" style="zoom:80%;" />

    In the pair, (2, 3) we see that there is an edge that connects them but one can go between them in any direction. 
    The maximum number of edges in a undirected graph is given by, $n(n-1)/2$ , where $n$ is the total number of vertices.  

*   **Directed Graphs** - in these graphs, the edges have a specific direction. We can see in the example below: 

    <img src="Graph_notes.assets/image-20201222133444596.png" alt="image-20201222133444596" style="zoom:80%;" />

    Taking the same example, we see that for a pair (2, 3) there is just one way to go between 2 and 3. The total number of edges in a directed graph is $n(n-1)$, where $n$ is the total number of vertices. 

### Graph Representation

There are two common ways to represent a graph. These are: 

*   **Adjacency Matrix** - This is a 2D matrix where a cell contains a boolean. The vertex number if listed on top and the side of the matrix. Think of it as a confusion matrix but bigger. When there is an edge between the two vertices, we  represent that with `1`. The figure below shows the representation of a undirected graph in an adjacency matrix: 

    <img src="Graph_notes.assets/image-20201222134636569.png" alt="image-20201222134636569" style="zoom:80%;" />

    The adjacency matrix is different for a directed graph. When the above graph is directed, we get something like this: 

    <img src="Graph_notes.assets/image-20201222134747533.png" alt="image-20201222134747533" style="zoom:80%;" />

    We can see that the matrix is much more sparse for a directed graph than for undirected graph.
    
*   **Adjacency List** - Rather than representing with a matrix, we can represent a graph as a linked list. Each vertex has its own linked list. For a undirected graph, the adjacency list looks like this: 

    <img src="Graph_notes.assets/image-20201222135206525.png" alt="image-20201222135206525" style="zoom:80%;" />

    For a directed graph, the representation looks something like this: 
    <img src="Graph_notes.assets/image-20201222135330600.png" alt="image-20201222135330600" style="zoom:80%;" />

    

    We see that each vertex is much smaller linked list than in undirected graph. 

## Graph Implementation

Let's implement the adjacency list method of graph representation. The implementation will be for a directed graph. We will create a class and represent the following graph. 

<img src="Graph_notes.assets/image-20201222135634682.png" alt="image-20201222135634682" style="zoom:80%;" />

The graph class consists of two data members: 

*   The total number of vertices in the graph
*   A list of linked lists to store adjacent vertices

```python
from ll import LinkedList

class Graph():
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.vertices = vertices
        self.array = []
        
        for i in range(vertices):
            temp = LinkedList()
            self.array.append(temp)
```

As we have seen here, each vertex has an associated LinkedList. So, the class takes in the number of vertices. Next, we define an array which will store these vertices. Finally, we create a linked list associated with each vertex and store these linked lists into the array. So, we now have a list of linked lists. 

Next we will create few functionalities. These include: 

*   `add_edge()`
*   `print_graph()`

```python
def add_edge(self, source, destination):
    if source < self.vertices and destination < self.vertices:
        self.array[source].insert_at_head(destination)
```

This is for directed graph. If we had a undirected graph, then we would write this as: 

```python
def add_edge(self, source, destination):
    if source < self.vertices and destination < self.vertices:
        self.array[source].insert_at_head(destination)
        self.array[destination].insert_at_head(source)
```

The Graph constructor stores the linked list based on the indexes so it gets easier later to index a node based on the index. Now, when we implement a directed graph, then ```add_edge(0, 1)``` is not equal to `add_edge(1, 0)`. But when we have undirected graph, we create from source to destination and from destination to source. 

We should also consider the edge cases, when `source < 0` or when `destination < 0`.  



Finally, here's the code to represent a graph: 

```python
def print_graph(self):
    print(">>Adjacency List of Directed Graph<<")
    print
    for i in range(self.vertices):
        print("|", i, end=" | => ")
        temp = self.array[i].get_head()
        while(temp is not None):
            print("[", temp.data, end=" ] -> ")
            temp = temp.next_element
            print("None")
```

### Graph Operation Complexities

The graph complexities are defined in the table below where **V** stands for the total number of vertices and **E** stands for the total number of edges.

#### Adjacency List

-   Adding an edge in adjacency lists takes constant time as we only need to insert at the **head** node of the corresponding vertex.
-   Removing an edge takes O(E) time because, in the worst case, all the edges could be at a single vertex and hence, we would have to traverse all **E** edges to reach the last one.
-   Removing a vertex takes O(V + E) time because we have to delete all its edges and then reindex the rest of the list one step back in order to fill the deleted spot.
-   Searching an edge between a pair of vertices can take up to O(V) if all **V** nodes are present at a certain index and we have to traverse them.

#### Adjacency Matrix 

-   Edge operations are performed in constant time as we only need to manipulate the value in the particular cell.
-   Vertex operations are performed in O(V2) since we need to add rows and columns. We will also need to fill all the new cells.
-   Searching an edge is O(1) because we can access each edge by indexing.

#### Comparison

Both representations are suitable for different situations. If your application frequently manipulates vertices, the adjacency list is a better choice.

If you are dealing primarily with edges, the adjacency matrix is the more efficient approach.

Keep these complexities in mind because they will give you a better idea about the time complexities of the several algorithms weâ€™ll see in this section.

## Graph Traversal Algorithms

Graph traversal means visiting every vertex in the graph. There are two basic techniques used for graph traversal. These are: 

*   Breadth First Search (BFS)
*   Depth First Search (DFS)

In order to understand these algorithms, we need to first look at graphs in a slightly different way. The graph is not a linear data structure so there is no one starting point and one end point. So, how do we traverse a graph? Rather than points, graphs have levels. 

Take any starting point. This becomes our lowest level in our search. The next level corresponds to all the adjacent vertices. The next higher level would be vertices adjacent to the vertices to just looked at and so forth. 

### Breadth First Search 

This algorithm travels all the vertices at the same level first before moving on to the next level. It goes wide and then deep. Here's how the BFS looks like: 

![image-20201222150222009](Graph_notes.assets/image-20201222150222009.png)



The top is the starting point. We randomly decided to start from the vertex 1. In the BFS, we go down to 2 followed by 3 and then to 4, 5, and finally to 6. 

Note that if this were an undirected graph, the BFS would then be: 

```python
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5
```

This is because the vertex marked `6` is at the same level  as `2, 3` due to this edge from `1`. 

### Depth First Search

In this case, we go deep before we go wide. So, using our previous example, a DFS would look like:
