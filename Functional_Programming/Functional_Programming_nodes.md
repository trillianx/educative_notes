# Functional Programming

The functional programming paradigm can be a powerful tool, especially as it can be integrated seamlessly with procedural and object-oriented code in Python.   In this course, you’ll learn what functional programming is, how it’s used, and the features of Python that support it. To start, you’ll learn how functions act as objects, the role of mutability, and how to perform recursion.   In the latter half of the course, you’ll focus on closures, iterables & iterators, generators, and more. Throughout the course will be three exams which will test your understanding and really drive home what you’ve learned.   By the end, you’ll have a new programming paradigm to add under your belt and have the confidence to start using functional programming in your own projects

## Introduction

Python supports three major programming paradigms: **procedular, object-oriented programming, ** and **functional programming**. The latter is the least understood but it can be an equally powerful tool in your coding repetoire. 

Let's look at these three major programming paradigms in detail.
